TODO:
Write tests!
More conditions/error handling. See below.
Scrobbling with a UNIX-TIMESTAMP demonstrates a bug in logging, specifically ADD-LOG-ENTRY.
-- Still there?
Ensure that error code 9 (bad session) is specially handled.
Ensure that error codes other than 9,11,16 do not result in re-sent scrobbles?
-- Last.fm seems to suggest other errors indicate malformed requests.
Move the bordeaux-threads make-thread call *into* scrobbler-init?

Ideas:
Add conditions/error-handling for:
-- get-api-keys, request-user-auth, lastfm-call, authorize-scrobbling
-- If an API call fails because we lack a valid session, kick off authorize!
Defcall can't support optional args.
-- Not a priority but a "nice to have" later.
At some point, we should support "switching users", i.e. auth a new session.
