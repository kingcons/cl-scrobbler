TODO:
Write now-playing and scrobble support.
Add caching.
Use cl-store to handle session, cache?
Add conditions + error-handling.
Write tests!
Defcall can't support optional args.
-- Not a priority but a "nice to have" later.


Ideas:
Overhaul the Request Authorization from User process...
-- Informing the user to open link X in their browser is simplest.
-- Asking user to input their browser and opening the link for them is better.
-- Performing `which firefox`, chrome, etc and presenting options is best?
Add conditions/error-handling for:
-- get-api-keys, request-user-auth, lastfm-call
-- handshake catch for: banned, badauth, badtime, failed
-- use it in defcall
-- Should have a condition for incorrect username+password
-- Should cache when network connectivity is absent and scrobble later.
Support XML in addition to JSON as a response format?
