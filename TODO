TODO:
WRITE IT!
-- Should have a condition for incorrect username+password
-- Should cache when network connectivity is absent and scrobble later.
---- Cache location should be configurable, obviously. :)
Right now the api-key is read at compile-time. We really want the symbol.
-- User shouldn't have to load api-keys and recompile!
-- Can we fix this by having make-signature handle quoted symbols?
We should really add Submission Protocol 2.0 support at some point...
Use cl-store to handle session and possibly api key+secret.
Cleanup style + docstrings.
Write tests!

Ideas:
Add conditions/error-handling for:
-- get-api-keys, request-user-auth, lastfm-call
-- handshake catch for: banned, badauth, badtime, failed
Add a keyarg to get-api-keys to read input from the user and save it to a file.
Trim down or consolidate the globals in config some.
Overhaul the Request Authorization from User process...
-- Informing the user to open link X in their browser is simplest.
-- Asking user to input their browser and opening the link for them is better.
-- Performing `which firefox`, chrome, etc and presenting options is best?
Support Mobile or Web Authentication in addition to DesktopAuth?
Support XML in addition to JSON as a response format?

Questions:
Is there a good way to let people use cl-scrobbler without:
-- A) Requiring them to have their own API key+secret.
-- B) Requiring me to distribute my API key+secret.
-- Ideally, they would only need a last.fm user+pass.
