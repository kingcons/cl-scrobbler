TODO:
Write tests!
Add a retry-scrobbles function that has a with-logging/with-cache in it?
-- Library consumer shouldn't have to think about this.
-- All we want them to do is give us a config-dir, try to restore the cache
---- on init, if it exists, get a session for new users and fire off a thread
---- (or some such) to scrobble new tracks and occasionally retry old ones.
More conditions/error handling. See below.
Scrobbling with a UNIX-TIMESTAMP demonstrates a bug in logging, specifically ADD-LOG-ENTRY.
Also, cleanup maybe-enqueue-scrobble. Esp. braindead *session-key* usage...
Improve get-session-key for new users.
Ensure that error codes 9 (bad session) is specially handled.
Ensure that error codes other than 9,11,16 do not result in resent scrobbles?
-- Last.fm seems to suggest other errors indicate malformed requests.
Move the bordeaux-threads make-thread call *into* scrobbler-init?

Ideas:
Add conditions/error-handling for:
-- get-api-keys, request-user-auth, lastfm-call, authorize-scrobbling
-- If an API call fails because we lack a valid session, kick off authorize!
Support XML in addition to JSON as a response format?
Defcall can't support optional args.
-- Not a priority but a "nice to have" later.
At some point, we should support "switching users", i.e. auth a new session.
